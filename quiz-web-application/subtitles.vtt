00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Some call me nature.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Others call me “Mother Nature.”

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I’ve been here for over 4.5 billion years.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
22,500 times longer than you.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
I don’t really need people.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
But people need me.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Yes, your future depends on me.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.999
When I thrive,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
you thrive.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.999
When I falter,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.999
you falter.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.999
Or worse.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.999
But I’ve been here for eons.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.999
I have fed species greater than you.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.999
And I have starved species greater than you.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.999
My oceans.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.999
My soil.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.999
My flowing streams.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.999
My forests.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.999
They all can take you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.999
Or leave you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.999
How you choose to live each day,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.999
whether you regard or disregard me,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.999
doesn’t really matter to me.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.999
One way.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.999
Or the other.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.999
Your actions will determine your fate.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:35.999
Not mine.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.999
I am nature.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.999
I will go on.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.999
I am prepared to evolve.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.999
Are you?
